ArmadilloV8 - Final project for Computer Architecture and Organization where we were to build a virtual CPU from scratch using Logisim-Evolution. Included in this task was designing the CPU architecture, defining opcodes, an instruction set architecture
  for programmers to interface with the CPU, and a python script to parse user-written code into opcodes and instruction-memory images.

Cybersecurity Labs - A compilation of various labs done in different topics of cybersecurity from application exploitation to web security vulnerabilities.

HowToCode - Final project for Web Programming and Project Development where in a group, we designed and coded a website meant to give users a jumping off-point to learn basic things about programming. Built with HTML, CSS, and JS.

IT Security Scripts - Various scripts written for Introduction to IT Security assignments usually to simulate various encryption-decryption protocols, and secure prime number generation.

Linux Device Drivers - Two programming assignments for Operating Systems where the task was to interface with linux device (specifically character) drivers and to extend them with functionality.

NavAI - Final project for Software Development Process which consisted of designing and implementing software for a self-driving vehicle. This project included a 50+ page write-up describing everything from conception to requirements to
  actual implementation, alongside the code itself for the vehicle written mostly in C++.

mbrizzioproj (Exploitation Project) - Final Project for Systems Security where we were given a program compiled with various defenses like ASLR, RELRO, NX-pages, and Stack Canaries and 4 tasks to complete: 
    1. Leaking mprotect() and win() function addresses
    2. Using leaked addresses to hijack program control-flow
    3. Using mprotect() address and multiple gadgets to hijack control-flow and make user-controlled page in the heap executable.
    4. Using the above solution in task 3 to open a reverse shell
  This was all completed through a format-string vulnerability which gave the attacker the ability to leak run-time addresses and use them with a heap-overflow vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. In this project folder are the 4 tasks and a write-up
    describing the exploitation of the vulnerable program.

Minishell - Programming assignment for Systems Programming where the task was to create a simulated shell that could execute various commands given by the user.

Vehicle Office Database - Final project for Database Management Systems where the task was to write a java program that used a mySQL server to control a database of drivers and check for errors, mismatches, and more.
